Here I used the YOLOv8 model and trained it with a white-hot thermal image dataset (21,622 test images https://universe.roboflow.com/roboflow-universe-projects/people-detection-thermal/dataset/5) and a rainbow-colour palette of thermal images (6111 images, https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/thermal-image-dataset-person-detection-uniri-tid).

It is meant to be used for autonomous drones in search and rescue after disasters to detect humans

It is still in a very rough condition and requires refining. Future versions with more training will follow.
